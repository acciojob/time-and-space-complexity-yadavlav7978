	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of its input. It's crucial to design algorithms with efficient time complexity to ensure optimal performance.

    <p>
        Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of its input. One common notation used to describe space complexity is O(n), where n represents the size of the input.
        <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is a critical consideration, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained memory environments.
